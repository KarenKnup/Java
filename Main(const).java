	Constructors:
Constructors are special methods invoked when an object is created and are used to initialize them. 

A constructor can be used to provide initial values for object attributes.

- A constructor name must be same as its class name.

- A constructor must have no explicit return type.

Example of a constructor:

public class Vehicle {
  private String color;
  Vehicle() {
     color = "Red";
  }
}

The Vehicle() method is the constructor of our class, so whenever an object of that class is created, the color attribute will be set to "Red".

A constructor can also take parameters to initialize attributes.

public class Vehicle {
  private String color;
  Vehicle(String c) {
    color = c;
  }
}

You can think of constructors as methods that will set up your class by default, so you don’t need to repeat the same code every time.

	Using Constructors:
The constructor is called when you create an object using the new keyword.

Example:

public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    Vehicle v = new Vehicle("Blue");
  }
}

This will call the constructor, which will set the color attribute to "Blue".

	Constructors:
A single class can have multiple constructors with different numbers of parameters.

The setter methods inside the constructors can be used to set the attribute values.

Example:

public class Vehicle {
  private String color;

  Vehicle() {
    this.setColor("Red");
  }
  Vehicle(String c) {
    this.setColor(c);
  }

  // Setter
  public void setColor(String c) {
    this.color = c;
  }
}

The class above has two constructors, one without any parameters setting the color attribute to a default value of "Red", and another constructor that accepts a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

Now, we can use the constructors to create objects of our class.


//color will be "Red"
Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();

//color will be "Green"
Vehicle v2 = new Vehicle("Green");

Java automatically provides a default constructor, so all classes have a constructor, whether one is specifically defined or not.
